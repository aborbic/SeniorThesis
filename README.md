# SeniorThesis
An Application that I worked on in my final year of College. I built a search tool that is comprised of a list of all student organizations on campus. Entirely Java and SQL was used. Put in your name and follow the steps to also add your organizations. Then, it will use organizations that up to 5 friends are also in and give you the top results for which organization you should use. The SQL queries were managed through mySql. I used XAMPP preferably. This Project is far from perfect.
